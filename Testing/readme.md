# Introduction

The Max-Sum algorithm is a GDL (Generalized Distributive Law) algorithm that operates on a factor graph.

## Usage
All parameters are required. The Test file (Main) is located in Testing/DFSParallelConditioningHG.py
```bash
python DFSParallelConditioningHG.py -iterations=nIterations -instances=nIstances -op=min/max -file=FILE.r
```

## Output
It creates a directory called as input file, that contains:

 - **TestingColoring_Report.txt**:  FILE about the average of the rmessages differences. 
 - **factor_graph.txt**:  FILE about the Factor Graph, cost tables and other information about Dcop
 - **ConflictsChart.png**:  Chart with the trend of the MaxSum values during the iterations
